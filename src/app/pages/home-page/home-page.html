        <span class="project-header">[ Redacted ]</span>
        <p>Redacted is a pesonal company that I am wanting to work on some time in the future.
            I can't reveal to many details right now, but I want to help encourage highschooler,
            and young adults to harnest their creativity to become authors. Writing is a way, much
            like reading to pull yourself into another world, only they create it. Writing uses 
            logic and story telling components to teach kids how to communicate exactly what it is
            that they want to portray. If you have any idea's or want to be a part of it let me know.
        </p>

        <span class="project-header">About this website</span>
        <p><p>This website is a personal project that I've been wanting to work on
            for quite a while. While it is still a work in progress (as it likely 
            always be), I'm using it to learn cloudflare, angular, node.JS, databases,
            as well as some backend API solutions. 
            Furthermore, I've also been working on my UI design skills. So, bare with me 
            as I learn how to make coherent layouts.
            Feel free to send me a email with suggestions or any problems you find.
